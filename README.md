# Overview
Meal-Plan-Automation is a Google Sheet tool importing selected data into Google Tasks by category including assigned upcoming date. Each meal converts into  a google task with ingredients created as subtasks. As a result, running Meal-Plan-Automation creates a grocery list in Google Tasks based on the meals selected in the Google Sheet. 

# Additional Tool Features
- For dropdowns left unselected, the tool will skip the meal and not create a task.
- The ability to reset all dropdowns to default titles to choose new meals for the next week.
